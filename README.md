<h3>Reflection 1</h3>
Clean Code and Secure Coding principles I have applied to my code are:
- Meaningful names <br>
I use meaningful and descriptive variable names such as, productId, productName, newProduct, currentProduct.
- Small, One task, descriptive functions<br>
I use functions that are small, they only do one task, and I give them descriptive names such as, findById, create, edit, delete.
